Empirical is a library of tools for developing efficient, reliable, and accessible scientific
software.

Tools in Empirical include:
* Web-enabled elements to facilitate compiling to JavaScript and with a full web interfaces,
  using Mozilla's Emscripten compiler (from C++ to high-efficiency JavaScript).
* Debug tools to facilitate fast memory management, which are turned off outside of debug mode.
* Evolution tools for building Artificial Life or Evolutionary Computation software.
* Many other helper tools to streamline common scientific computing tasks (configuration,
  randomization, bit manipulation, etc.)

See https://empirical.readthedocs.io/en/latest/html/files.html for more detailed documentation
on the available source files.

--== Sub-folders in source/ directory ==--

base/     - Debug tools used throughout Emperical for fast and efficient memory management.
config/   - Tools to build a simple configuration system (including compile-time optimizations)
data/     - Tools for easy data management and output.
geometry/ - Geometry and physics-based tools for implementing simple virtual worlds.
hardware/ - Implementation of basic virtual hardware that is easy to configure.
meta/     - Helpful tools for template meta-programming.
scholar/  - Tools for tracking authors, citations, and bibliographies
tools/    - Many basic tools that are generally useful for scientific software.
web/      - Tools for builing web interfaces

Evo/         - Specialized tools for building Artificial Life or Evolutionary Computation projects
in_progress/ - Tools that are being worked on, but not at all ready for public consumption
stand_alone/ - Versions of tools found elsewhere in Empricial that can be downloaded as a single
               file with no additional dependencies.


--== Executables directories ==--

examples/ - Example code for many of the above tools
tests/    - Unit tests
utils/    - mini projects using Empirical with broad utility.


Each source file should have at least one of the following statuses:

* DESIGN - Notes are in place, but no (or minimal) working code
* ALPHA - Some basic functionality works, but more features still need to be added and tested
* BETA - Basic functionality is all in place, but needs more thorough testing.
* RELEASE - Well-tested functionality and used in multiple projects, at least by authors.
* STABLE - Used by many non-authors in assorted projects without fixes for extended period.

* ABANDONED - May have worked, or may not; no longer being developed.
* BROKEN - Once worked (at least BETA level), but now needs to be repaired (not abandoned!)
* CLEANUP - At least BETA, but need code cleanup, fixing of warnings, etc.
* DEPRECATED - Functionality has been replaced and should shift to replacement.
* EXPLORATORY - Some functionality may work, but needs re-engineering to get right.
* EXTERNAL - Part of another project (cited above); not developed as part of Empirical.
