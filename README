A library of tools for developing efficient scientific software, with the added ability of
compiling to the web and building web interfaces using the Emscripten compiler (from C++ to
high-efficiency JavaScript).

--== Source files directories ==--

meta/     - Helpful tools for template meta-programming.
tools/    - Many basic tools that are generally useful for scientific software.

config/   - Tools to build a simple configuration system (including compile-time optimizations)
evo/      - Tools for building Artificial Life or Evolutionary Computation projects
geometry/ - Geometry and physics-based tools for implementing simple virtual worlds.
hardware/ - Implementation of basic virtual hardware that is easy to configure.
scholar/  - Tools for tracking authors, citations, and bibliographies
web/      - Tools for builing web interfaces

--== Executables directories ==--

examples/ - Example code for many of the above tools
tests/    - Unit tests
utils/    - mini projects using Empirical with broad utility.


Each source file should have at least one of the following statuses:

* DESIGN - Notes are in place, but no (or minimal) working code
* ALPHA - Some basic functionality works, but more features still need to be added and tested
* BETA - Basic functionality is all in place, but needs more thorough testing.
* RELEASE - Well-tested functionality and used in multiple projects, at least by authors.
* STABLE - Used by many non-authors in assorted projects without fixes for extended period.

* ABANDONED - May have worked, or may not; no longer being developed.
* BROKEN - Once worked (at least BETA level), but now needs to be repaired (not abandoned!)
* CLEANUP - At least BETA, but need code cleanup, fixing of warnings, etc.
* DEPRECATED - Functionality has been replaced and should shift to replacement.
* EXPLORATORY - Some functionality may work, but needs re-engineering to get right.
* EXTERNAL - Part of another project (cited above); not developed as part of Empirical.
