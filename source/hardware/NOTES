Below is a levelized list of the main components of a virtual CPU.

InstNode - Information about a single instruction in a genome (id and possible arguments.)

LinearCode - A vector of InstNode (do we even need a class?)

HardwareState - Current state of an indivual's hardware.  Can have LinearCode for memory.

InstLib - A library that map instruction names to functions (that take the InstNode and 
	HardwareState to modify.

Processor - Takes an InstLib, a HardwareState, and a LinearCode and runs that code
	(The code is translated with the InstLib and modified the HardwareState)
