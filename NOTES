Explore if quick-looking up for sin, cos, tan should be at higher resolution (no it's 256 entires).

Come up with a cleaner method to time functions?  Current macro is pretty ugly.


-= Useful Tools =-
A simple-to-modify and fast phenotype object
A genotype manager (for organisms with identical genomes)
