-= Next Steps =-
Fix how sectors are handled in surfaces to be more dynamic based on sizes of organisms.
- Consider sorting organisms by size and processing smallest first?
  Then any particular comparison is only up against as small or smaller.

-= Questions =-
Best way to convert to a c++ literal independent of type?


-= Near Future =-
Build a test system
Move scheduler over to Empirical
Build (find?) a logging system?
Consider new serialization options
- Option 1: Use only emp-specific types in classes that can be easily saved?
            (Makes coding harder)
- Option 2: #define overrides for types?  (tricky to get right, especially for STL types)
- Option 3: Require manual save a load functions?  (Requires all programmers to always keep updated,
            but might be possible with good automated test system.)
Explore Box2D to handle physics instead of my current scheme.
A data management system that can track data by:
  - Temporal series (values over time)
  - Batch (where a batch reset occurs periodicall)
  - Log (tracking particular events when they occur)
  All output files should have headers that allow them to be read back in more easily.
A citation tool? Useful for pointing people to appropriate references to learn more about a component.

-= Optimizations to Explore =-
Explore if quick-looking up for sin, cos, tan should be at higher resolution (now it's 256 entires).
Currently doing all-pairs comparisons to detect collisions.  Other options:
* Sort by X first, stop second loop when x-distance > diameter
* Put circles into sectors; only check same or neighboring sectors
* Put circles into strips that we use the x-sorting technique on.
* Keep list of nearby circles updating only occasionally (base on velocity?) (using one of above methods?)
If insturction functions are stored in a fixed array (rather than vector), one fewer indirection would be need to look them up.

-= Other TODOs =-
Come up with a cleaner method to time functions?  Current macro is pretty ugly.

-= Improvements =-
InstLib: Can we lock in a set of instruction as compile time?  Or at least put them in a fixed array?

-= Useful Evolution Tools =-
Virtual Hardware Object - processes a genome using virtual hardware.
Organism Object (Contains Genome and templated on virtual hardware type)
Genotype manager (for organisms with identical genomes)
Simple-to-modify and fast phenotype object (similar to config)
Phenotype summary to include in the genotype
Phylogeny/lineage manager with multiple modes of purging (and link to phenotypes?)
Clade manager that will mark into phenotypes which clades they are associated with

-= Specific ideas for Configurtion tools =-
* Should be able to output its own config header for basic settings. (test more?)
* Build links into setting variables that will trigger function calls
* Warn more gracefully if a variable/const name is used more than once?
* Build an HTML object to automatically allow adjustment of settings in a running ap.
* Require a "set" command before each setting.  This allows for other types of commands.
* Allow other commands to redirect the rest of the line to a specific object for processing.
