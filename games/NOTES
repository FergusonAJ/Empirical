All games should have common function for easy use in templates:

void Reset()
     Restart the game (using the same settings)

bool DoMove(size_t player, size_t move)
     Specify a move to be made by a player.
     Return value indicates if player needs to make another decisions (or go again)

bool IsDone()
     Test: is the game finished?

bool IsMoveValid(size_t player, size_t move)
     Test: is a provided move legal? 

double GetScore(size_t player)
     How is the specified player doing?
     In a binary win/lose game, these scores will be 0/1 at the end of the game.

void Print(std::ostream & os=std::cout)
     Print out the current state of the game.
