In order to customize this template, you must:

* Put these files into the directory for your project.
* Update the license to one of your choice (and with your copyright)
* Edit the beginning of Makefile to set the name of the project and the location of Empirical.
* Update the names of source/web/project_name-web.cc and source/native/project_name.cc
* Edit web/project_name.html to update the project name and associated javascript file name.

Type `make all` and make sure everything compiles!

The provided `make test` runs a bare bones check that the native and web executables provide the expected "Hello, world!" output.
As you implement your own project, comsider updating, replacing, or disabling the `make test` functionality.
The packsge.json file catalogs the Node dependencies required for this testing.
We also provide a template travis.yml file as a jumping off point for hooking up your project to continuous integration.
